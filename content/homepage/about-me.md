Hi, I’m David (*Funky Penguin*). I've been running [mining pools in Kubernetes since early 2019](https://blog.turtlecoin.lol/archives/funkypenguins-turtle-pool-secrets/).

I’ve spent 20+ years working with technology. I’m a solution architect, with a broad range of experience and skills. I’m an [AWS Certified Solution Architect (Professional)](https://www.certmetrics.com/amazon/public/badge.aspx?i=4&t=c&d=2019-02-22&ci=AWS00794574), a CNCF-Certified Kubernetes Administrator (pending examination!), a [helm-chart developer](https://hub.helm.sh/charts?q=funkypenguin), and a remote worker. 

I’ve written a [book](https://www.packtpub.com/hardware-and-creative/phplist-2-e-mail-campaign-manager), established a [thriving community of like-minded container-geeks](https://geek-cookbook.funkypenguin.co.nz/), and I [blog](https://www.funkypenguin.co.nz/blog/) on topics that interest me.

You can find me on GitHub, Twitter, Email, or Discord
